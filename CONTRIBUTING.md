# Contributing to MRSA Biofilm Surveillance Dashboard

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the MRSA Biofilm Surveillance Dashboard! This project focuses on AI-driven genomic surveillance and mechanistic inference for high-biofilm MRSA lineages.

## üéØ How to Contribute

### Research Collaborations
This project is developed for research purposes in antimicrobial resistance and genomic surveillance. We welcome collaborations from:

- **Microbiologists** studying MRSA biofilm formation
- **Bioinformaticians** working on genomic surveillance
- **Data scientists** interested in ML applications in microbiology
- **Clinical researchers** focusing on antimicrobial resistance

### Types of Contributions

1. **Bug Reports**: Help us identify and fix issues
2. **Feature Requests**: Suggest new functionality
3. **Code Contributions**: Improve algorithms or add features
4. **Documentation**: Enhance user guides and scientific background
5. **Data Contributions**: Share relevant MRSA datasets (with appropriate permissions)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- Basic understanding of microbiology and bioinformatics
- Familiarity with Streamlit (for web interface modifications)

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Genom2.git
   cd Genom2
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## üìã Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style

- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Include comments for complex algorithms

### Commit Messages
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Start with a verb (Add, Fix, Update, etc.)
- Reference issues when applicable

### Pull Requests
1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Make your changes
3. Test thoroughly
4. Submit a pull request with:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Scientific rationale (if applicable)
   - Screenshots for UI changes

## üß¨ Scientific Contributions
